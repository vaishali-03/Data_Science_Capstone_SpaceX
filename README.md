# Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX
Through this Data Science Capstone Project, I predicted if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its 
website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore,
if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can also determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX
for a rocket launch.
This capstone project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered by IBM and Coursera.
